# xbox-user-checker
checks available xbox users and saves them to a file
again im back with a project i never posted nor bothered finishing/putting effort into but as you can read it is again self explanatory but it requires you type the length of the user, if it should contain numbers, and how many you want generated, it will tell you to press ENTER to begin (after inputting the required info) or too TYPE CANCEL this will stop the script, again i didnt make this today and i dont plan to update it, alot of users are taken but i suppose this tool is for someone who wants an easy way to find usernames that arent taken, it tells you if no names are available in the list it generated, if there are then bravo, if not then you can always try again.. i will post some other unfinished projects and i will test them/fix before i post it fully, some may have no relevance to eachother but i dont care.. peace out for now and enjoy
